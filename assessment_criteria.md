Below are some proposed criteria for assessing performance on group
projects; both other teams&rsquo; projects and the performance of peers on
your own team.

These assessments will be made on-line, after the completion of your
presentations.  All of your assessments of other people or groups
will be strictly **confidential**, but not anonymous (the instructor
and GSIs will be able to identify the author of the assessments).


# Assessment of Group Projects

Each person will complete a survey giving an assessment of each
groups&rsquo; project presentation.  Assessment questions may include:


## Code

-   Did the team provide a link to the code it used for the project?
-   Were you able to run the code?
-   Were you able to replicate the results reported by the team?
    -   If not, did you report the replication problem to the team?
        -   If so, did they respond constructively?
-   Did you review the code?
    -   If so, how would you rate the code in terms of:
        -   Clarity
        -   Elegance


## Topic & Goals

-   How interesting was the team&rsquo;s topic?
-   Do the team&rsquo;s goals clearly address the topic?
-   How ambitious are the team&rsquo;s goals?


## Presentation

-   In terms of original goals, how much did the team accomplish?
-   How interesting were visualizations?
-   How polished was the video presentation?
-   Overall, how compelling was the team&rsquo;s presentation?


## Organization

-   How well did the team seem to work together?
-   Did the team&rsquo;s collaboration tools seem effective?
-   How well was presentation time managed by the team?


## Overall

-   Score the the overall impact of the team&rsquo;s project and presentation 
    on scale of 0&#x2013;100.
-   If you were in the position of needing to hire a team to do work
    on population analysis, would you hire this team?  Why or why
    not?

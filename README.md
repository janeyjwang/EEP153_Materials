For each project, you will also be evaluated in terms of your *engagement*.  This is the one category which will be evaluated solely by instructors and GSIs, rather than by your peers.  Particular things we will look at:

-   Number and quality of comments, etc. on [edstem.org](https://edstem.org).
-   Number and quality  of comments and issues on github repositories (both yours and others).
-   Number and quality of comments or PRs specifically pertaining to issues/bugs in code or material in EEP153 repos, including
    -   <https://github.com/ligonteaching/EEP153_Materials/issues>
    -   <https://github.com/ligonteaching/EEP153_Exercises/issues>

But where is this growth coming from?  \n\nFood (and crops in particular) are the classical example of \nproduction.  The &ldquo;classical&rdquo; economists in the 18th century, when\nmost income came from agriculture, thought there were three main\n&ldquo;factors&rdquo; of production:\n\n-   Land\n-   Labor\n-   Capital\n\nThus one might write the technical relationship between &ldquo;factors&rdquo; (or\ninputs) and output as\n$$\n    \\text{Crop output} = F(\\mbox{Land},\\mbox{Labor},\\mbox{Capital}).\n $$\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Functional forms\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["We have good reason to think that $F$ displays constant returns to\nscale; i.e., is homogeneous of degree one.  Write it as\n$F(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n)$ (thus abstracting from the classical factors\nof production).  \n\nObservationally, it&rsquo;s also often the case the cost share for\ndifferent factors of production remains constant, even when prices\nchange.  If we combine these facts (linearly homogeneous, constant\ncost shares) with an assumption that farmers operating this\nproduction function are profit maximizing price-takers and a\ntechnical assumption that $F$ is continuously differentiable, then\none can prove that $F$ is &ldquo;Cobb-Douglas&rdquo;, or\n$$\n      F(x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_n) = A\\prod_{i=1}^nx_i^{\\alpha_i},\n  $$\nwhere $\\sum_{i=1}^n\\alpha_i=1$.  This is a result first established\nby the economist Paul Douglas and the mathematician Charles Cobb in 1928.\n\nIf we observe output at time $t$ for country $j$, say $y^j_t$ and inputs $x^j_{it}$, we can take the\nlogarithm of the Cobb-Douglas production function, obtaining\n$$\n     \\log y^j_t = \\log A^j_t + \\sum_{i=1}^n\\alpha^j_i\\log(x^j_{it}).\n  $$\nNote that we&rsquo;ve allowed the cost-share parameters $\\alpha$ to vary\nacross both inputs and also countries, but *not* over time.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Total Factor Productivity\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["The term $A$ is sometimes called &ldquo;Total Factor Productivity&rdquo; (TFP),\nbecause increases in $A$ increase productivity of all factors.
